However, the Exact Set Match Accuracy (EM) score is 0.0, indicating that the result set does not fully answer the question. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.\n\nExecutionAccuracy: The Execution Accuracy score is 0.0, indicating that the generated SQL query is not a match with the groundtruth answer. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.\n\nFaultless: The generated SQL query ran without any errors, as indicated by the empty `sql_query_run_error` field. Therefore, I will award 1 point for this criterion.\n\nValidEfficiencyScore: The Valid Efficiency Score (VES) is 0.0, which means that the runtime of the generated SQL query is not similar or better than the groundtruth query. Therefore, I will not award a point for this criterion.","usage":"{\"inputTokens\": 1530, \"outputTokens\": 53, \"totalTokens\": 1583}","latency":2188,"cost":0.00044875,"ex_score":0.0,"em_score":0.0,"ves_score":0.0,"sql_query_run_error":null,"sql_query_run_result":["('New Orleans Cajun Delights', 'P.O.
